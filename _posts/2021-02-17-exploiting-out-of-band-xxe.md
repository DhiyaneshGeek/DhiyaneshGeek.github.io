  This vulnerability was found during the  External Adversary Simulation Category, where we used to test for Web Application and Network Assets to find Critical Server Side bugs so that we can exfiltrate data and get an inital foothold.
  
**Let's Dive Deep into it!**

There were hundreds of login pages and credentials that we obtained from Deep / Dark Web Exposure were also not working :(
