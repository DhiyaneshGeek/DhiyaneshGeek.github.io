The CTF format was in jeopardy. which has all type of challenges such as **Web, Mobile, Network , OSINT , Cloud, Misc, Programming**.

Rules for the CTF are quite simple. **No automated scripts allowed** which creates heavy traffic.

Note : “The more you solve the points of the challenges get decrease due to the dynamic pointing system”
