The CTF format was in jeopardy. which has all type of challenges such as **Web, Mobile, Network , OSINT , Cloud, Misc, Programming**.

Rules for the CTF are quite simple. **No automated scripts allowed** which creates heavy traffic.

**Step 5 :** Then checking the format found it is **PNG** and tried to fix the corrupted magic number of the Image using the following command

```bash
hexeditor code.png
```

**Magic Number of PNG** - 89 50 4E 47

**Step 8 :** Went back to the Android Application and click on **WingaduimLeviosa** and we got this below error message.

Note : From the above error message found that this application has some strings that are Encrypted 

**Step 9 :** Now Let's start the Static Analysis using **Apktool** using the following command

```bash
apktool d Ronproject.apk
```

**Step 10 :** After that move into the **Ronproject** directory and check the **AndroidManifest.xml** file , found that it is a `Flutter Application` .

</p>

**Step 11 :** Did a quick Google Search "How to decompile Flutter apk** and endup with this Link <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53666487/flutter-debug-apk-decompile-to-get-source-code>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym4/android6.png">
</p>

**Step 12 :** So after going through the stackoverflow , understood that in each and every flutter application there will be `kernel_blob.bin` file which has the decompiled code of the application.
